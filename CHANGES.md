# Waggle-Tempest Change Log

## 2025-10-11 - Initial Implementation and Waggle Publishing

### Major Features Implemented

#### 1. Tempest Data Publishing to Waggle âœ…
**Status**: Complete and functional

**What was done**:
- Implemented full Waggle publishing functionality in `publish_tempest_data()` function
- Publishes comprehensive weather data from Tempest station to Waggle message stream
- Added support for all major Tempest message types:
  - `obs_st`: Comprehensive weather observations
  - `rapid_wind`: High-frequency wind updates
  - `hub_status`: System status information

**Published Topics** (20+ data points):
- Wind: speed (lull/avg/gust/instant), direction
- Environmental: temperature, humidity, pressure
- Light: illuminance, UV index, solar radiation
- Precipitation: rain accumulation (report/daily)
- Lightning: distance, strike count
- System: battery, report interval, hub firmware, uptime, RSSI
- Status: plugin health indicator

#### 2. Publish Interval Throttling âš¡
**Problem**: Original code had `--publish-interval` parameter but wasn't using it

**Solution**:
- Added `last_publish_times` dictionary to track last publish time per message type
- Implemented per-message-type throttling in `publish_tempest_data()`
- Added time-elapsed checking before publishing
- Configured default 60-second interval to prevent message overflow

**Benefits**:
- Prevents overwhelming Waggle message stream
- Reduces network/storage load
- Maintains data freshness (always publishes latest value)
- Independent throttling for obs_st, rapid_wind, and hub_status

#### 3. Configuration Improvements ðŸ”§

**Command-Line Arguments**:
- Connected `--publish-interval` argument to actual publishing logic
- Made `--udp-port` configurable throughout the codebase
- Passed UDP port to listener thread properly

**Global State Management**:
- Added `publish_interval` global variable
- Added `last_publish_times` tracking dictionary
- Properly initialized in `main()` function

#### 4. Enhanced Logging ðŸ“Š

**Improved visibility**:
- Added ðŸ“¥ indicator when UDP messages are received
- Added ðŸ“¡ indicator when data is published to Waggle
- Enhanced publish messages with key data values
- Debug messages explain throttling decisions

**Examples**:
```
ðŸ“¥ Received obs_st message from 192.168.1.50
ðŸ“¡ Published obs_st data: Wind 12.3 kt @ 245Â°, Temp 18.5Â°C, RH 65%
Skipping rapid_wind publish - only 3.2s elapsed (need 60s)
```

### Code Changes

#### main.py

**Lines 28-36**: Added global state for publishing control
```python
# Global plugin instance and publishing control
plugin = None
last_publish_times = {}  # Track last publish time for each message type
publish_interval = 60  # Default publish interval in seconds
```

**Lines 151-171**: Implemented throttling logic in `publish_tempest_data()`
- Added `force` parameter for future use
- Check elapsed time since last publish
- Skip publishing if interval not met
- Update last publish time on successful publish

**Lines 221, 232, 243**: Enhanced logging with data summaries
- obs_st: Shows wind, temperature, humidity
- rapid_wind: Shows instant wind values
- hub_status: Shows firmware, uptime, RSSI

**Line 256**: Made UDP port configurable in listener
```python
def tempest_udp_listener(logger, udp_port=UDP_PORT):
```

**Line 272**: Added debug logging for received messages
```python
logger.debug(f"ðŸ“¥ Received {msg_type} message from {addr[0]}")
```

**Line 288**: Clarified comment about throttled publishing
```python
# Attempt to publish the data (will be throttled based on publish_interval)
```

**Lines 349-361**: Properly initialized publish_interval from args
```python
global plugin, publish_interval
# ...
publish_interval = args.publish_interval
```

**Line 392**: Pass UDP port to listener thread
```python
args=(logger, args.udp_port),
```

### Documentation Changes

#### README.md

**Lines 234-248**: Added "Publishing Throttling" section
- Explains how throttling works
- Documents configuration options
- Provides example with timing
- Clarifies benefits (prevents overflow while maintaining freshness)

### Technical Details

#### Publishing Flow
1. **UDP Reception**: Continuous listening on port 50222 (or configured port)
2. **Immediate Parsing**: All messages parsed in real-time
3. **Throttled Publishing**: Only publish if interval elapsed
4. **Latest Data**: Most recent parsed data published (no averaging)

#### Throttling Mechanism
- Per-message-type tracking (independent intervals)
- Time-based (not count-based)
- Configurable via command-line
- Debug logging for skipped publishes

#### Error Handling
- Invalid messages logged but don't stop operation
- Plugin status published on errors
- Graceful degradation on connection issues

### Testing Recommendations

Before deployment, verify:
1. Tempest UDP broadcasts are received
2. Data is published to Waggle at correct intervals
3. Throttling works correctly for each message type
4. Debug logging shows expected behavior
5. Firewall rules allow UDP port 50222

### Configuration Examples

**Default (60-second intervals)**:
```bash
python3 main.py
```

**Faster updates (30-second intervals)**:
```bash
python3 main.py --publish-interval 30
```

**Debug mode with custom port**:
```bash
python3 main.py --debug --udp-port 50223 --publish-interval 45
```

### Deployment Notes

- Requires `waggle>=0.7.0` package
- Uses only standard library (except waggle)
- Requires host networking or UDP broadcast access
- Default publish interval (60s) recommended for production
- Can run alongside waggle-davis without conflicts

### Known Limitations

- No data aggregation (publishes latest value only)
- No historical buffering (real-time only)
- No automatic UDP reconnection (runs continuously)
- No multi-station support (single Tempest per instance)

### Future Work

See TODO.md for potential enhancements including:
- Data aggregation options
- Historical buffering
- Prometheus metrics
- Unit/integration tests
- Configuration file support

---

**Summary**: The Tempest Weather Station Waggle Plugin is now fully functional with proper data publishing, intelligent throttling, and comprehensive logging. Ready for deployment and testing with actual Tempest hardware.
